New updates for CWS Project CS2450
This will build an entry widget that no matter what you input
the maximum you can enter (press Tab) will be the first 5 keys
however you can enter any type of char
Do not make using .pack a habit
this puts the entry widget in the space of a resieble tk frame
of any size.
you will also want to alter the % values for self._validate
This only checks the value that was entered that is 5 chars or less

Note: If you want to use this type of widget control you will also want to use a
mixin wrapper which really wants you to use Multiple Inheritence. For this project
trys and catches may be a better choise. There are pleny of examples on the internet
which you can find using "validation of widget values". If you want to try this out
before you go on to Multiple Inheritance or multiple classes using something like what
you see below, check out https://anzeljg.github.io/rin2/book2/2405/docs/tkinter/entry-validation.html
for starters.
